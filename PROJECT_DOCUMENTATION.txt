- Account settings management
- Account deletion with confirmation

Files:
- /app/auth/signin/page.tsx - Login page
- /app/auth/signup/page.tsx - Registration page

- /components/templates/SapphireTemplate.tsx - Blue professional template
- /app/dashboard/templates/page.tsx - Template selection interface

How it works:
Users can choose from pre-designed templates that automatically style their
portfolio content. Each template has unique color schemes, typography, and
layout arrangements optimized for professional presentation.

3. PORTFOLIO CONTENT MANAGEMENT
-------------------------------
Features:
- Personal information editing (name, bio, job title)
